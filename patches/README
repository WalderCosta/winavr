WinAVR Patches
==============

The patches are organized into subdirectories according to project and version
number of that project.

Each patch filename is prefixed with a two digit number. This number classifies
the patch into the following areas:

    0x = Distribution specific (distro names and versions)
    1x = Host platform specific
    2x = Build system specific
    3x = New target features
    4x = Patches to fix target bugs
    5x = New devices
    6x = Monolithic patches (that have not yet been decomposed into the above categories)

This number also determines the order in which the patches are applied.
